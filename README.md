# üõ°Ô∏è Born2BeRoot

## üìù Project Overview

**Born2BeRoot** is a system administration project from 42 School designed to introduce students to virtualization and server configuration. You will set up your first virtual machine following strict guidelines, using either VirtualBox or UTM. By the end of the project, you will be able to configure your own operating system with a set of stringent security rules.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pre-requisites

- üñ•Ô∏è VirtualBox or UTM (if VirtualBox doesn't work)
- üõ†Ô∏è Latest stable version of **Debian** or **Rocky Linux**
- üìö Basic understanding of Linux command line and system administration

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Virtual Machine**: Create a virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM.
- **System Configuration**: Configure your server following strict rules.
- **Security**: Implement strong password policies, configure `sudo` and `SSH`, and set up a firewall.

## üîß Mandatory Part

1. **Operating System**:
   - Use the latest stable version of Debian or Rocky Linux.
   - Configure the system without any graphical interface (No X.org or similar).

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Create at least 2 encrypted partitions using LVM.

3. **Security Policies**:
   - Implement a strong password policy (minimum length, expiration, complexity).
   - Configure `sudo` with specific rules.
   - Install and configure the SSH service on port `4242` with restricted root access.

4. **Firewall**:
   - Configure `ufw` for Debian or `firewalld` for Rocky, allowing only necessary ports.

5. **Hostname**:
   - Set the hostname to your login followed by "42" (e.g., `user42`).

6. **Monitoring Script**:
   - Create a script named `monitoring.sh` that displays system information every 10 minutes using the `wall` command. The information should include:
     - OS architecture and kernel version
     - Number of physical and virtual cores
     - RAM usage and available disk space
     - CPU load
     - Last boot time
     - LVM status
     - Active connections and users
     - IP address and MAC address
     - Number of `sudo` commands executed

## ‚ú® Bonus Part

1. **Advanced Partitioning**:
   - Configure partitions to obtain a specific structure as required.

2. **Web Server**:
   - Set up a functional WordPress site using `lighttpd`, `MariaDB`, and `PHP`.

3. **Additional Service**:
   - Configure an additional useful service (excluding `NGINX`/`Apache2`). You must justify your choice during the defense.

## üñ•Ô∏è Scripts

### Monitoring Script Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simple monitoring script to display system information every 10 minutes

architecture=$(uname -a)
cpu_physical=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
cpu_virtual=$(grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
ram_usage=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf "%.2f%%\n", $3/$2 * 100}')
disk_usage=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{total+=$3} END {print total}')
cpu_load=$(vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{print $15}')
last_boot=$(who -b | awk '{print $3 " " $4}')
lvm_use=$(lsblk | grep -q lvm && echo "Yes" || echo "No")
tcp_connections=$(ss -ta | grep ESTAB | wc -l)
user_log=$(who | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l)
ip=$(hostname -I)
mac=$(ip link show | grep link/ether | awk '{print $2}')
sudo_commands=$(grep -c "COMMAND" /var/log/sudo/sudo.log)

echo "#Architecture: $architecture"
echo "#CPU physical: $cpu_physical"
echo "#vCPU: $cpu_virtual"
echo "#Memory Usage: $ram_usage"
echo "#Disk Usage: $disk_usage"
echo "#CPU load: $cpu_load"
echo "#Last boot: $last_boot"
echo "#LVM use: $lvm_use"
echo "#TCP Connections: $tcp_connections"
echo "#User log: $user_log"
echo "#Network: IP $ip ($mac)"
echo "#Sudo : $sudo_commands cmd"
```

## üöÄ Project Delivery and Evaluation

- üìÅ Submit only a `signature.txt` file in the root of your repository.
- üìù This file should contain the SHA-1 signature of your virtual disk.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure your VM is configured correctly as it will be evaluated based on the criteria listed above.
